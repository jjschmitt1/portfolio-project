                        {/*Hello! My name is JJ Schmitt, and I am a December 2024 graduate of UW-Madison. I enjoy playing golf, 
                        cooking, lifting weights, spending time with family and friends, and both playing and watching soccer. 
                        Iâ€™m also a passionate fan of Chicago and UW-Madison sports.

                        My journey into programming began in 5th grade, when a traveling coding class introduced my elementary 
                        school to drag-and-drop coding. From there, I was fortunate to attend a middle and high school that 
                        offered a wide range of programming courses, allowing me to develop and refine my skills over the years. 
                        I've been coding ever since!*/}
                        Hello! My name is JJ Schmitt and I recently graduated from UW-Madison with a B.S. in Computer Science and
                        minors in Math and German. Since graduation, I've spent time learning new programming languages, attempting 
                        to get into shape, and building projects that I either find interesting or align with my future career goals.
                        My current career goal is to earn a position as an entry level data engineer. The combination of coding and
                        manipulating numbers is something that I feel innately drawn towards. Outside of my professional life, I love
                        to play golf, lift weights, cook protein-heavy meals, watch sports, and hang with my friends. Thanks for checking
                        out my website!
